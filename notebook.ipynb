Most of the cases closed takes around 150 - 210 days (~5-7 months). Even though there is a possibility that the case takes more than 250 to manage. For some insight, there might be special cases that cause the problem to solve need more time than others therefore the legal team could identify and make some classification for certain uncommon cases that take more than 6 month.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"09ff2140-997e-4e55-acda-82cfc7d75165"},{"source":"## Task 4","metadata":{},"id":"c5fbe3a0-d277-437c-a1a0-f1edf80684f7","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Describe the relationship between time to close and location.
